frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is a project I completed as part of my Grow with Google Scholarship through Udacity’s Front-End Web Development course. This is very basic, I plan to add more functionality as my skills grow, including the ability to select a character, gems and other items to collect, rocks to avoid, a scoring system, and a game end/reset function. 

Installation:
•	Clone or download the repository
•	Open index.html to play the game in your browser.

Or, point your browser to: http://www.kianese.com/arcade_game.html

How to Play:
1.	Move your character up, down, left, or right, using the arrow keys. 
2.	Avoid the bugs!
3.	When you get to the top, you return to the bottom center and can play again.
4.	If you hit a bug, you return to start. 
5.	Have fun!

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
