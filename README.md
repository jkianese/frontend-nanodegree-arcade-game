How to Play:

Move your character to the top and don't hit any bugs. That's it!

If you do hit a bug, fear not my friend, you just go back to start and try again. You have unlimited chances (for now). 

I plan to add more functionality, such as the ability to allow the user to select his or her own character, random gems and other items to collect, rocks to avoid, a scoring system, a game end/reset, and maybe even a clock. For now, it's about as basic as it gets.

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
