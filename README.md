===============================

This is a project I completed as part of my Grow with Google Scholarship through Udacity’s Front-End Web Development course. This is very basic, I plan to add more functionality as my skills grow, including the ability to select a character, gems and other items to collect, rocks to avoid, a scoring system, and a game end/reset function. 

Installation Instructions:

•	Clone or download the repository

•	Open index.html to play the game in your browser.

Or, point your browser to: http://www.kianese.com/arcade_game.html

How to Play:
1.	Move your character up, down, left, or right, using the arrow keys. 
2.	Avoid the bugs!
3.	When you get to the top, you return to the bottom center and can play again.
4.	If you hit a bug, you return to start. 
5.	Have fun!
